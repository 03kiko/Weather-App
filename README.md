# Weather App
This project is a simple weather application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application displays the current weather conditions for the user's location, using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It was created following a tutorial by WebDevSimplified on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0VEOghdMpQ&t=1244s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) and was my first introduction to these technologies.
