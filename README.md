# Weather App
This project constitutes a simple weather application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application fetches and displays current weather conditions for the user's location, utilizing data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It served as a means to reinforce my grasp of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and was constructed following a [tutorial by WebDevSimplified](https://youtu.be/w0VEOghdMpQ).
